# Deep Learning Algorithm
### Convolutional Neural Networks
---------
This repository contains the codes for the convolutional neural network implementation in Python language.
The code has been written in **Python** using *Scipy, Numpy and Matplotlib.*

--------

### Running the code:

* Download the data files.
* Install Anaconda, for satisfying all the dependencies from [here](https://anaconda.org/).
* Put them in the same folder, and run the program by typing in 'python CNN.py' in the command line
* The data files  were also obtained using the same code
* This code takes a long processing time
